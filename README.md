# pygame-udyam

My submission for Udyam 2017 event as is.
I made this game within the duration of a week as I learnt python for the first time, so do forgive the quality of code.
The entrypoint is `main.py`. 
## Requirements
Do ensure that you have installed the python library `pygame` before running.
To install do `pip install pygame`
